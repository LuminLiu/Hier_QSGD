# Hier_QSGD

Code for the experimental part of the paper Hierarchical Federated Learning with Quantization: Convergence Analysis and System Design, arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14272, Accepted by Transactions on Wireless Communications.

This repository contains the code for the following experiments:

- Theoretical convergence for the Hier-QSGD algorithm,
- Verification of the two design guidelines,
- Implementation of the proposed adaptive algorithm.


The proof.pdf file includes the proof for our theorem in the ICC paper "Client-Edge-Cloud Hierarchical Federated Learning".

Please open an issue if you have questions or problems.
