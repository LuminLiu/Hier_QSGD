This repository contains the code for the following experiments:

- Theoretical convergence for the Hier-QSGD algorithm,
- Verification of the two design guidelines,
- Implementation of the proposed adaptive algorithm.


The proof.pdf file includes the proof for our theorem in the ICC2020 paper "Client-Edge-Cloud Hierarchical Federated Learning".
