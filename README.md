# Hier_QSGD

Code for the experimental part of the paper Hierarchical Federated Learning with Quantization: Convergence Analysis and System Design, arXiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14272, currently under review.

This repository contains the code for the following experiments:

- Theoretical convergence for the Hier-QSGD algorithm,
- Verification of the two design guidelines,
- Implementation of the proposed adaptive algorithm.

Use `notebooks/plots.ipynb` to visualize the results.

Please open an issue if you have questions or problems.
